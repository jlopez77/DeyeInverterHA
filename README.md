![Quality: Silver](https://img.shields.io/badge/Quality-Silver-silver)

## Overview

This custom integration allows Home Assistant to read **real-time data** from **Deye hybrid inverters** over Modbus TCP, using a mapping file based on `DYRealTime.txt` and powered by [`PySolarmanV5`](https://github.com/jlopez77/pysolarmanv5) and `pymodbus`.

It provides a single sensor entity ‚Äî **`sensor.deye_inverter`** ‚Äî with a wide set of inverter metrics exposed via `extra_state_attributes`.

## Features

- üì° Real-time data from Deye hybrid inverters
- üß† Based on `PySolarmanV5` and `pymodbus`
- üß© UI-based configuration (no YAML needed)
- üìä Exposes 50+ inverter metrics as sensor attributes
- üí° Works offline ‚Äî no cloud dependency

## Installation

This integration is **not yet in HACS**. You can install it manually for now:

### Requirements

- Home Assistant 2021.12 or newer
- Network access to your inverter's Modbus TCP interface

### Manual Steps

1. Download or clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jlopez77/DeyeInverterHA.git

2. Copy the folder:

   ```bash
   custom_components/deyeinverter

  into your Home Assistant config directory:

   ```bash
   config/custom_components/deyeinverter
```
3. Restart Home Assistant.

4. In the UI, go to Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration, search for Deye Inverter, and follow the setup steps.

## Configuration
Once installed, the integration can be configured entirely through the Home Assistant UI.

You will be asked for:

Host: The IP address of your inverter
Port: Modbus TCP port (default: 8899)
Serial Number: The inverter‚Äôs serial number
Installed Power (kW): For production % estimation

## Entities
### Main Sensor
sensor.deye_inverter
Represents total inverter PV production (PV1 + PV2). This sensor includes all inverter metrics as attributes.

## Available Attributes

## Troubleshooting

üîå No data / Sensor unavailable:

Check inverter IP and port (default is usually 8899)
Verify that the inverter is online and responding to Modbus TCP
Check if the serial number is correct

‚öôÔ∏è Integration not showing up:

Make sure files are correctly placed under config/custom_components/deyeinverter

Restart Home Assistant
